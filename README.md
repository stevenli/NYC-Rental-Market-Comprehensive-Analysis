# NYC-Rental-Market-Comprehensive-Analysis

## Data Source

The dataset 'rental' is extracted from rental website, it is a daily screenshot of New York City rental market. I will utilize this dataset to visualize and construct models so as to deliver a comprehensive view for newyorkers who is struggling to find their next apartment.

The dataset contains three main boroughs of New York City (exclude Staten Island and Bronx) and their submarkets as well as neighborhoods, displayed by categorical variables. Descriptive numerical metrics are used to show detailed apartment information. Variable 'rent' is dependent variable that will be predicted in models.
